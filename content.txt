1. class and object (example)
2. class of object has data/attribute  and has its functions/methods.
      > code walkthrough
      > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually.
3. why python is called OOP? - everthing in python is object.
4. Advantages of Oops.
      > create ur own datatype(int, str, etc.)
      > code reusability
      > debugging
      > easy to colab
5. End to End project 
      > function vs method
      > magic or dunder method
      > u can create attribute outside class as well
      >encapsulation
      > getter and setter
      > static method
6.Inheritence
      > Code example
      > why its needed? (code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
      > what gets inherited? - Contructor, Non private attributes and methods.
      > Constructor overloading & method overloading
      > Super keyword(used only in inside class, cannot accvariables/attributes, used only inside child class.
